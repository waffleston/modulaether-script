# modulaether-script
Speeding up development of modular javascript applications.
## What is it?
It's essentially a javascript preprocessing language, currently able to speed up the initial page load by placing non-immediate functions in another file.  These functions are then asynchronously loaded by the browser after the page renders.
## Todo:
* [ ] Maintain tabs/spaces before lines.
* [ ] Build-in optional minification/obfuscation.
* [ ] Allow batch jobs.
* [ ] Syntax validation.
* [ ] Advanced dummy functions.
* [ ] Expand beyond explicit function manoeuvring.
